# Basic Informational Site with Node.js

A simple informational website built with Node.js. This project was created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum to practice creating a web server from scratch using only the native **`http`** and **`fs`** (File System) modules.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of Node.js by building a server that handles basic routing. The focus is entirely on the backend logic for receiving requests and serving the appropriate static HTML files.

**Note**: The HTML content and styling for the pages were generated by an AI. This was done to provide a pleasant visual interface without distracting from the main learning objective: the Node.js server implementation.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Static Page Serving**: Serves `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact-me.html`.
- **Custom 404 Page**: Displays a `404.html` page for any URL that doesn't match a defined route.
- **No Dependencies**: Built entirely with built-in Node.js modules. No `npm install` needed!
- **Basic Routing**: Implements a simple routing system to direct users to the correct page.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/linzi-v7/static-node-server.git](https://github.com/linzi-v7/static-node-server.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project's root directory:**
    ```sh
    cd static-node-server
    ```

3.  **Run the server from the root directory:**
    ```sh
    node app/index.js
    ```
    *This command tells Node to run the `index.js` file located inside the `app` folder.*

4.  **Open your browser** and visit one of the URLs below. By default, the server runs on port 8080.

## 🛣️ Available Routes

The server will serve a specific page for the following routes:

-   **Home**: `http://localhost:8080/` -> `views/index.html`
-   **About**: `http://localhost:8080/about` -> `views/about.html`
-   **Contact**: `http://localhost:8080/contact-us` -> `views/contact-me.html`
-   **Not Found**: Any other URL -> `views/404.html`
